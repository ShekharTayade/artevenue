								<p>Arte’Venue is a one of a kind platform where 
								you get to choose from a range of more than 2,50,000
								art prints of various artists and genres worldwide. 
								You even have the option of customizing the size of 
								your print and adding a mount and a frame of your 
								choice. You will then see how your finished product 
								will look and you will have it delivered to your 
								doorstep just as you see it. 
								</p>

								the art and framing industry we wanted to offer 
								customers a possibility to procure art as they like 
								it and/or frame their souvenirs from the comfort of 
								their home making it both time and cost effective. 
								From the inception of this idea until its 
								realization a lot of thought, time and effort has 
								produced Arte’Venue for you.
