			<strong>COVID-19 Impact:</strong> As you are aware, the Codiv-19 situation in the 
			country has forced central and state governments to implement a lockdown across country.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Safety Measures:</strong> We are following the government directives and 
			guidelines for our staff and 
			factory workers and taking all the safety measures. We have asked our staff to 
			work from home and halted our production temporarily.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Impact to us:</strong>	It has impacted our order processing and production. 
			Our delivery partner carriers are also unable to deliver currently. 
			So, kindly be informed that the orders will get delayed.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Can you still order?</strong> You can still go ahead and order as we will resume 
			our operations as soon as situation nears normal. We will take up orders for processing 
			in the sequence it was received.
			
			<p>
			<strong>What about orders already places?</strong> 
			You need not worry about the orders already placed with us. We will do our best 
			and deliver those as soon as situation nears normal. 
			</p>
