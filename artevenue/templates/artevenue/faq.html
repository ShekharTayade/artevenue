								<h2>Ordering</h2>
								<strong>How do I place an order?</strong>

								<p>	Add the product(s) you wish to order in your shopping 
									cart by clicking on the "Add to Cart" button 
									located next to the product image. When you're
									ready to complete your order, click "Continue 
									Checkout" from within your cart and follow 
									the instructions.
								</p>

								<strong>Does the image on your site accurately 
									represent what I will be sent?</strong>

								<p>We strive for a high degree of image accuracy. 
									You can expect a 90-100% accuracy to the image
									viewed on our site.
								</p>

								<strong>How accurate are the item dimensions 
									listed on your web pages?</strong>

								<p>ArteVenue.com checks the dimensions of all 
									images on our site, but due to industry 
									standards sizes can vary slightly up to 2‚Äù. 
								</p>
								
								<strong>What are the resolution requirements for 
								digital upload orders?</strong>

								<p>Our minimum resolution for digital uploads is 
									150 DPI. Since resolution reduces as you enlarge 
									a photo, the higher the resolution of your file, 
									the larger your print can be. If you'd like to 
									print a larger photo than what is suggested, 
									you'll need to upload a higher-resolution image 
									of your photo to have a larger print to a maximum 
									size of 40x60 inch.
								</p>

								<strong>What kind of image can I upload to be 
									printed?</strong>

								<p>You can upload a .jpg, or .gif, under 30MB 
									and we'll print and frame it for you! 
								</p>
								
								
								<hr>
								<h2>Shipping & Delivery</h2>
								<strong>What type of packaging do you use?</strong>

								<p>Your art print is rolled with butter paper 
									to protect it against dust and then inserted 
									in a tube to keep from any kind of damage 
									during transit.
								</p>
								<strong>When will my art arrive?</strong>

								<p>You can estimate your art's arrival between 
									5-10 days depending on the delivery point.
								</p>

								<strong>How do I track my order?</strong>

								<p>All the orders are shipped through FedEx. 
									You will receive an AWB number through which 
									you can track your order.
								</p>
								
								<strong>How much will shipping cost?</strong>
								<p>Shipping is free.</p>

								<strong>What is your return & cancellation policy?</strong>
								<p>We are committed to quality products and your 
									satisfaction is 100% guaranteed. We print and 
									customize the art as per your order and our
